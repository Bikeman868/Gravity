# TODO List

- Delay node
- Cloud provider detection
- Bot detection
- Honey pot
- Caching node
- Content transformation

## Delay processing

Instead of blocking bad actors forcing them to change their attack, 
just slow them down by delaying their requests

## Cloud provider detection

Most cloud hosting platforms have an API that will retrieve a list
of all CIDR blocks used by that service. We can use these APIs to
figure out where the user agent is hosted and define processing
logic based on that.

# Bot detection

Use the user agent header and the IP address to identify bots allowing
them to be handled differently from regular traffic.

## Honey pot

Server a static version of the website directly from within the load
balancer. Bad actors can be routed to a honey pot so that they think
their bot is working but it is not impacting the back-end servers.

## Caching

Have Gravity cache eligible resources and serve them on subsequent 
requests to reduce load on the back-end servers.

## Content transformation

We need another scripting language that will transform the content as
it is streamed through the load-balancer (incoming and outgoing). The
current URL Rewriter scripting language can only change the head part
of the request and response.
